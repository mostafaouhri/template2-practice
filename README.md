# Kisper

**Kisper** is a simple web design project built using only **HTML** and **CSS**, inspired by what I learned from the [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/@ElzeroWebSchool) channel. It focuses on creating a clean and responsive layout using core front-end skills.

## 📌 Project Description

Kisper is a static landing page that demonstrates my ability to structure HTML and style components using modern CSS techniques without any JavaScript or external frameworks.

## 🚀 Live Demo

A live version of the project will be available soon.
